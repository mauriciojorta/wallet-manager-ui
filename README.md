# Wallet Manager UI

A simple demo of a digital currency wallet UI thought out for an hypothetical admin panel to monitor customer users and make transfers between their wallets.


## Used technologies

The UI is built with vanilla **React**. The styling is done with **Bootstrap** and **Font Awesome** libraries. 

## Installation and configuration steps

First of all, you should install and run the [Wallet Manager API](https://github.com/mauriciojorta/wallet-manager-api) app in your local environment. 

Then, if you havent't them, install [nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/es/) and, in the root of this project, run *npm i* to install all the dependencies of the UI application. After the process finishes, then run *npm start* and in a matter of seconds the app should be deployed on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
